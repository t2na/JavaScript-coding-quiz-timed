# JavaScript-coding-quiz-timed
A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions

Description

The attached project file(s) are for our fourth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to create our own JavaScript coding quiz website. In my example, I use 10 multiple choice questions with a 60-second timer. Each correct answer adds 10 points to your score, and each incorrect answer subtracts 10 points from your score, as well as subtracts 10 seconds from the timer. When the timer runs out, the quiz is over. Some of the parameters we were we were instructed to abide by were to make sure that there was a time penalty for incorrect answers and to make it so that users could save their scores at the end of the game. In my example, the users top 15 scores would be continuously saved.

This project greatly tested my ability to use functions, variables and arrays in JavaScript, in addition to testing my ability to use Bootstrap for styling. Initially, what I found most difficult was leveraging objects and arrays to generate the 10 questions. As you can see in my GitHub commits, my original strategy was to write out each question's logic individually in JavaScript, before realizing that this was counterintuitive to the spirit of the project, as well as inhibiting to its scalability - it would be difficult to add or change questions later. With the help of my teachers, TAs, and tutors, I was able to re-configure the coding quiz to correctly leverage objects, arrays, strings, as well as JSON methods.

Installation

No installation is required to enjoy the fruits of the project, simply visit the github pages URL.

Usage

In order to "use" the website, simply visit the URL and leverage Chrome's dev tools in order to take a look at the code that I created.

Credits

This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors and TAs.
